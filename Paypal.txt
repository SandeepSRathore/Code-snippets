Congratulations,you have made all the configurations required for the Paypal payment.

Now lets come to JAVA part to handle success/failure from paypal.

Create a method in controller to handle paypal redirection URL like below(you will get mulitple request parameters like "st","amt","cc","tx" status,amount,currency,transaction id etc.).

    @RequestMapping(value="/paypal/success")  //this url should map which you configured in step 5
    	public String success(ModelMap modelMap,HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest,Model uiModel) throws Exception{
    		Enumeration<String> parameterNames = httpServletRequest.getParameterNames();
    
    		while (parameterNames.hasMoreElements()) {
    
    			String paramName = parameterNames.nextElement();
    			System.out.println("paramName : "+paramName);
    			String[] paramValues = httpServletRequest.getParameterValues(paramName);
    
    			for (int i = 0; i < paramValues.length; i++) {
    				String paramValue = paramValues[i];
    				System.out.println("paramName : " + paramName+ ",paramValue : " + paramValue);
                    //your logic goes here
    				
    			}
    		}
    
    	}
